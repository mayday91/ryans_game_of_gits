House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.
 
 Ned realized that violence is not the answer, and he opened up a little bakery in King's Landing, and invented the first donuts.
